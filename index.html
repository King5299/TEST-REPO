<P><big>My name is Sean King, but I go by Alex.</big></P>
<P>I worked all summer with my dad. I also went to amusement parks with friends</P>

</ul><b>My strengths are:</b></ul>
        <li><em>Memorization</em></li>
        <li><em>Determination</em></li>
<p>I am most excited for learning how to properly code in different languages</p>
<p>What concerns me is failing my classes. I am scared that I will not be able to handle the workload of college.</p>
<p>The five elements I used were a emphasis element, a bold element, a division element, a list element, and a header element.</p>
 <hr>
<h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
<p>For my enhancements I used a color for the background and text, a second header, a big element, an unordered list, and a border.</p>
<p> I learned a lot during this assignment. I learned how to write basic HTML. Things such as italicizing or coloring the text. I want to learn how to insert an image and link.</p>
