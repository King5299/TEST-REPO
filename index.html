<h1>Welcome</h1>
<body>
 <P>My name is Sean King, but I go by Alex.</P>
 <P>I worked all summer with my dad. I also went to amusement parks with friends</P>
 <body>
    </ul>My strengths are:</ul>
        <li>Memorization</li>
        <li>Determination</li>
<p>I am most excited for learning how to properly code in different languages</p>
<p>What concerns me is failing my classes. I am scared that I will not be able to handle the workload of college</p>

<h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
<p>The enhancements I used were a border, an unordered list, the list element, paragraphs, and headers.</p>
<p>I learned how to code in the most basic of html. I want to learn about how to incorporate colors into my code.</p>
